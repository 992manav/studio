## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Walmart Blue (#007DC6) to maintain brand recognition and instill trust. This reflects their corporate identity.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E5F1F8), which maintains the same color feeling of the primary color, without clashing
- Accent color: Yellow-Orange (#FFA52A) to draw attention to important elements, such as interactive buttons or special promotions within the virtual store. This draws from Walmart's visual style, without copying it.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, should be used to keep the tone neutral, clean and contemporary.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for navigation, product categories, and cart actions. Use the yellow-orange accent color (#FFA52A) on active elements.
- The layout should mimic the structure of a Walmart store. Product placement can either accurately represent or stylistically abstract the source material. Information on the page should follow F-shaped pattern, moving from the upper left.
- Subtle animations should guide users through the virtual shopping experience. For example, use animations when items are added to the cart or when navigating between sections of the store. Animation should remain responsive, to prevent motion sickness.
